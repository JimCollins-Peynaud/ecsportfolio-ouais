	  Back in April of 2023, I had an assignment to do in my American History class, which was to make a video of me explaining the 10 Amendments, AKA the Bill of Rights. 
	  After working on it for an entire week and presenting it to the class, so many people enjoyed it (my teacher even showed it as an example to students two years later, 
	  my sister was there to see it and tell me the story.) I was so proud of it that when my Aussie cousin came to visit us only a couple weeks later, we decided to do a 
	  mock-interview of an imaginary cheese entrepeneur (don't ask why). We continued making a sort of series, and I even plan to make a sequel this upcoming Spring Break.
