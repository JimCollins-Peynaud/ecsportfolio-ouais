	<p>I also have been a part of the International Geography Championships. I started off in a National US competition in Atlanta, in which I did quite well. 
	  Two years later, I also qualified for the Nationals in Chicago, which I was in the top 25. My first International competition was in Montreal, 
	  and I absolutely loved the city, as well as performing well, staying in the top 40. My most recent International competition was in Vienna, 
	  where I decided to get involved in more simulations rather than tests and exams. That was my best choice ever made because I got to connect 
	  with other comeptitors who simply wanted to have fun. They were all very nice and I got to connect and socialise a lot more. </p>

	  <p>I have not really joined any organisations, unless if the International Geography Championships are considered one.</p>

	  <p>For my tenth grade year, I'm hoping to start getting more involved in diplomacy clubs, as well as understand how politics work. 
	  I'd love to become a sort of diplomat one day, possibly even get a job at the United Nations.</p>
